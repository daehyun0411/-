      "['It was not the shot heard around the world, it was not a playoff clinching hit or a season turning moment as far as we can tell. What we do know for certain is that Seattle Mariner first baseman Dae-Ho Lee\\'s walk-off homer two-run homer with two outs in the bottom of the 10th inning Wednesday afternoon snapped a five game home losing streak and gave the M\\'s (3-6) a 4-2 win over the Texas Rangers (5-5) for their first win at home.\\n\\nThe walk-off wonder strike by the 6-foot-4, 250-pound Korean national was a gem of a gift to the 15, 075 Mariner faithful who showed up to cheer their team despite watching one of the worst home opening series by Mariners. The M\\'s team batting average during the home stand was a dismal .170 average with a home run percentage of 0.8 and an ERA of 4.50.\\n\\n\"We really, really needed it,\" manager Scott Servais said of the win and a players-only meeting that was held after an 8-0 loss to Texas on Tuesday. \"It was an important game. The guys got together after the game( Tuesday night) and talked about some things and they really wanted to get out and get it done today.\"\\n\\nRobinson Cano broke out of his homestand slump with a fifth-inning home run off of Rangers starter A.J. Griffin to give the Mariners a 2-1 lead. Cano was 2-for-21 on the six-game homestand before that long ball.\\n\\nAs has been the case during the home stand the Mariners bullpen surrendered the lead in the eight when Delino Deshields hit a leadoff home run against Mariner reliever Joel Peralta to tie the game at 2-all before Lee\\'s heroics.\\n\\nSeattle starter Taijuan Walker had a decent start pitching six innings, giving up five hits, one earned run, struck out four batter while walked two. Steve Cishek (1-1) pitched two scoreless innings and was credit with the win.\\n\\nSeattle will use Thursday as a travel day to New York, where they will take on the Yankees for a three game series. Right-hander Nathan Karns gets the start in Friday\\'s series opener at 4:05 p.m. PT on Jackie Robinson Day. Texas returns home for a three game series with the Baltimore Orioles starting on Thursday night.', 'Dae-ho Lee will look to make the jump from the Japanese ranks to the big leagues.\\n\\nKorean first baseman Dae-ho Lee will be looking to move on from the Japanese ranks. According to a report from Jee-ho Yoo of Yonhap News, he has declined his player option for the 2016 season with the Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks of the Nippon Professional Baseball league in Japan. He has decided to become an international free agent in hopes of landing a major-league contract.\\nThe 33-year-old first baseman had played in the Korean Baseball Organization in Korea for over a decade before making the move to west to Japan. Ever since 2012, Lee had been playing in Japan, playing for both the Orix Buffaloes and the Hawks.\\nSince he is becoming an unrestricted international free agent, Lee will not warrant a posting fee. That will likely drop the overall asking price and the process will be easier for both sides. “All baseball players dream of playing in the majors, and I’d like to pursue that dream,” Lee explained in his press conference. “If I can give 100 percent, like I’ve done throughout my career, I don’t think it will be impossible.”\\nIn 141 games played this season for the Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks, Lee posted a .282/.368/.524 slash line over 584 plate appearances, along with 31 home runs and 98 runs batted in. Over his fifteen-year career in both Korea and Japan, he is the proud owner of a .303/.387/.514 slash line over 7103 plate appearances, along with 323 home runs and 1157 runs batted in, in 1720 games played.', 'Lee Dae-ho, a Korean slugger currently playing with the SoftBank Hawks in Japan, has announced plans to pursue a career in Major League Baseball in the U.S.\\n\\nLee has earned recognition in Nippon Professional Baseball and was named MVP of the Japan Series this year. \\n\\n\"I\\'ve achieved my goals for this year. One was helping my team win the Japan Series and the other was becoming MVP,\" Lee said at a press event on Tuesday after returning home last weekend. \"It is now time to pursue my childhood dream of playing in the MLB.\" \\n\\nMeanwhile, another Korean player, Park Byung-ho of the Nexen Heroes, is waiting for bids from MLB teams after posting was made early this week.\\n\\nExpectations for the two players are high after Kang Jung-ho successfully transferred from the Nexen Heroes to the Pittsburgh Pirates last year.', 'Lee Dae-ho left for Arizona on Tuesday where the Seattle Mariners have spring training.\\n\\n\"Lee planned to leave for the U.S. after obtaining a work visa which takes about a month but changed his plans at the request of the team to join with teammates as early as possible,\" said his agency Montis Sports Management Group.\\n\\nLee is expected to start training this weekend.', 'Korean slugger Lee Dae-ho of the Fukuoka Softbank Hawks received the MVP award in the Japan Series of the Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB) league for his outstanding performance in leading his team to its second consecutive title Thursday.\\n\\nWith a two-run home run in the fourth inning, the slugger, 33, helped the Hawks to a 5-0 win over the Tokyo Yakult Swallows at the Jingu Stadium in Tokyo and lifted the Hawks to a 4-1 series win. It marked the seventh Japan Series title win for the Fukuoka-based team.\\n\\nThe two-run shot Lee blasted off Swallows starter Masanori Ishikawa was a decisive one, giving the Hawks an early 2-0 lead. The Hawks added two more runs in the top of the fifth and another in the ninth.\\n\\nDuring the series, Lee collected eight hits in 16 at-bats, including two home runs and eight RBIs.\\n\\n\"I am very pleased to win the series two consecutive years,\" Lee was quoted as saying after the game by Japanese media. \"Now, I can sleep in peace.\"\\n\\nLee attributed his MVP honor to his teammates, saying, \"The hitters in front of me did their jobs, getting on base, and I just brought them home. I am totally indebted to them.\" When asked how he will spend the prize money of 5 million yen ($41,350), Lee said he would take his teammates to dinner.\\n\\nThe Korean slugger not only became the first Korean MVP, but he is also the first foreign winner since the Orix BlueWave\\'s Troy Neel in 1996.\\n\\nThe former Lotte Giants player of the Korean Baseball Organization (KBO) had played in Korea for 11 seasons, recording a batting average of .309 with 225 home runs. He had his breakthrough season in 2006, capturing the Triple Crown, hitting .336 with 26 home runs and 88 RBIs.\\n\\nHe joined the Hawks from the 2014 season after spending two years with the Osaka-based Orix Buffaloes in 2012 and 2013. In the regular season this year, he batted .282 with 144 hits, including 31 home runs and 98 RBIs.', 'One bat was enough to decide the game for him. Korean major leaguer Lee Dae-ho of the Seattle Mariners closed a game by hitting his first come-from-behind home run since his debut in the Big League.\\n \\nOn Wednesday, Lee appeared in the batting box with a runner on first and launched a two-run blast in the bottom of the 10th inning against the Texas Rangers at Safeco Field in Seattle to lift the Mariners to a 4-2 victory. The Korean slugger readily hit a 97-mph fastball from left-hander Jake Diekman (29) and sent it over the left field wall, getting revenge for the previous faceoff with the same pitcher on Monday where the batter barely managed to hit a ground ball.      \\n \\nRobinson Cano (34) and other teammates all gathered around the home plate to celebrate Lee. Fans joined the celebration frantically, drawling his name \"Dae-ho\" just like his local fans from the Lotte Giants used to do. “Someone had to be a hero to put an end to the recent losing streaks, and I happened to be the hero. I swung lightly, but I was lucky enough to hit a high pitch,” said the South Korean during an interview after the game.    \\n \\nThanks to the victory, Lee Dae-ho became the first designated hitter to have belted a walk-off homer in his debut season since the foundation of the Seattle Mariners in 1977. Lee also became the second oldest rookie to hit a deciding home run following Luke Easter, the then 35-year-old rookie of Cleveland in 1950.   \\n \\nLee has set the record to land deciding hits in all three professional baseball leagues in Korea, Japan, and the U.S. The South Korean slugger pulled off three homers out of his four walk-off hits in Korea, and he hit two walk-off hits in Japan without a homer. This marks the fourth time that a Korean major league player has hit a walk-off home run, following Choi Hee-seop (2005, LA Dodgers) and Choo Shin-soo (2011, Cleveland and 2013, Cincinnati).  ', 'By The Korea Times Los Angeles staff\\n\\nLast year’s Japan Series MVP Lee Dae-ho improved his chance of making the Seattle Mariners’ roster with his first two-hit game of the spring Tuesday. One of them was also his first double.\\n\\nThe 33-year-old Korean slugger broke out of a mini 1 for 10 slump by going 2 for 3 against the Los Angeles Angels in Cactus League action in Arizona. With only 18 at-bats under his belt going into the game, it didn’t take much to make his numbers look good right away. After two hits in his first two at-bats, his batting average had reached .300 for the spring.\\n\\nLee’s first hit came in the very first inning, as he stepped into the batter’s box as the fifth hitter (DH) with two on board against lefty Andrew Heaney and delivered a clutch two-out line drive single to left to give the Mariners a 1-0 lead.\\n\\nHe stepped into the batter’s box with two outs again in the third inning, but had to wait until the fourth to get his second hit of the day, as the first base runner got picked off to end the inning.\\n\\nThe Angels changed the pitcher to right-hander Joe Smith, and Lee greeted him with his first double to leadoff the fourth. He would later come around to score on Daniel Robertson’s two-out double.\\n\\nLee grounded out to pitcher Al Alburquerque in the sixth before being replaced by another designated hitter candidate Jesus Montero.\\n\\nLee is now 6 for 21 (.286) with one double, one home run, five runs and four RBIs.\\n\\nAngels’ Korean first baseman Choi Ji-man went 1 for 4. His batting average stands at .258.', \"Korean first baseman Dae-ho Lee is getting some interest from a Major League Baseball team. He had been training with his former team the Lotte Giants in Arizona, but canceled plans according to Jee-ho Yoo of Korea's Yonhap News Agency. He indicated the trip has been postponed to meet an interested MLB team. Lee's former club the Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks of the Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB) are set to start Spring Training in a couple of weeks, and wish to retain the slugger.\\n\\nLee 6-4 290, listed as a first baseman, but would be more of a designated hitter in MLB. Last season, Lee smashed 31 home runs, knocking in 98 runs with a slash line of .282/.368/.524. Lee is just seeking a one-year deal according to the report, and could be of interest to the Houston Astros. Star prospect A.J. Reed will likely get some seasoning against advanced pitchers at AAA. A one-year deal for them would be an ideal set up. The Astros only have weak hitting Jonathan Singleton at first base to start the 2016 season. He could fit with any needing a right hand hitter to platoon at first base or designated hitter.\", 'The Seattle Mariners have had an extremely busy winter, signing breakout and bounce-back candidates galore. It seems that for all the moves the Mariners have made, they still are not done. On Wednesday, the Mariners finalized an agreement with Korean star Dae-Ho Lee on a one-year minor league deal.\\n\\nThe deal might not be as exciting as a Chris Davis signing or even a Byung-Ho Park signing (which I am still baffled at why the Mariners didn’t try to sign Park), but first baseman Lee has the potential to truly break out in MLB in 2016. Lee is by no means a prospect at the age of 33, but the potential to be an impact player and even take the first base job for the next few years is there.\\n\\n\\nLee is an interesting signing for Jerry Dipoto, as he doesn’t exactly fit into what the GM has looked for this offseason. At 6-foot-4, 280 pounds, he doesn’t exactly scream athletic specimen, but he makes up for it with his discipline at the plate. He has hit over a .300 batting average in seven of his last 10 seasons, split between KBO and NPB (South Korea and Japan). His career batting line between the two leagues is .303/.387/.514, which is sure to take the significant hit all Japanese and Korean players have seen when entering MLB.\\n\\nLee is by no means guaranteed a spot on the major league roster, but he definitely shows the potential to either back up at first base or take a DH type role with the team. Lee has decent defense at first base, but with his size he is not bound to impress with his athletic ability on the field. The mix of mediocre defense with an amazing presence at the plate would seem like a nice DH option for the Mariners, but Lee has to prove that he can accomplish in the U.S. what he did overseas. Also, with the crowded outfield the Mariners have, Nelson Cruz is likely to make the transition to DH this season (although Cruz would wish otherwise).\\n\\nLee is a two-time NPB champion (2014-15) and a three-time NPB All-Star (2012-14) in just four seasons in the NPB (2012-15). While playing in the KBO, he was voted the MVP of the league in 2010. Although Lee is more of a power hitter (even with his contact numbers), he is hoping that his success overseas will translate favorably in MLB. This is despite the perceived notion that all Asian players have a drastic decrease in power when entering MLB.\\n\\nThe plateau for Lee’s skill set in MLB would compare to David Ortiz at this point in his career. Ortiz in his prime was considered the cornerstone of the Boston Red Sox’ offense during the 2000s. Ortiz still has the skill to play on a major league roster in a prominent role, but he is definitely on the decline, announcing his retirement after 2016 earlier in the offseason. Lee’s size and plate discipline resemble Ortiz closely though, as they both like to crowd the plate, shrinking the strike zone for opposing pitchers.\\n\\nLee will have to prove himself in order to make the big league roster, but it was reported that he has $4 million in incentives if he can do so. While it is highly unlikely that Lee will make a major impact in the start of the season, he does have a chance to take the platoon spot at first base from Jesus Montero. Montero is out of minor league options though, creating a bit of a problem if Lee did make the 25-man roster.\\n\\nConsidering it is a largely incentive-based contract, the Mariners got a huge steal with Lee. If he doesn’t produce, it will cost the Mariners next to nothing. If he does perform well, then Lee will earn the money he rightfully deserves. Adam Lind needs a right-handed platoon partner, based on his split numbers. Lee could easily step into that role and become a fan favorite in Seattle.', \"The Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks expressed hopes of renewing a contract with slugger Lee Dae-ho, who was the Most Valuable Player in the Nippon Professional Baseball Japan Series last year.\\n\\nAfter the end of last season, Lee declared his wish to play in Major League Baseball, but he has not yet found a team.\\n\\nJapanese media reported on Tuesday that the club's chairman Sadaharu Oh mentioned the possibility of signing a contract with Lee in February.\\n\\nThe team had previously said the deadline for talks with Lee was before spring camp begins.\", 'LOS ANGELES -- The Los Angeles Dodgers no longer need to worry about left-hander Hyun-Jin Ryu opting out of his contract after next season. But they might need to start wondering if he’ll ever pitch for them again.\\n\\nDodgers manager Dave Roberts revealed before Saturday’s game against the visiting San Francisco Giants that Ryu had another physical setback, this time a groin strain that forced him to cancel his bullpen session. Ryu hasn’t pitched in a regular-season game since Oct. 6, 2014, a 3-1 loss to the St. Louis Cardinals in Game 3 of the National League Division Series. He dealt with on-and-off soreness in his throwing shoulder his first two seasons with the Dodgers, and the issue became especially problematic when he reported to spring training in 2015. He eventually underwent surgery to repair a torn labrum on May 21.\\n\\n\\nHyun-Jin Ryu\\'s health appears to be an issue again for the Dodgers. AP Photo/Mark J. Terrill\\nRyu began his throwing program Oct. 6, a year to the day after his last start for the Dodgers, but was still treated cautiously when spring training opened in late February. He was eventually shut down for a week due to soreness in the shoulder, then restarted his conditioning, still well behind the other pitchers.\\n\\nHe threw a 20-pitch simulated game last weekend and reportedly felt great, but then the news of his latest setback came to light Saturday.\\n\\n“We’re going to take a couple days to kind of let this calm down and then get him back on the mound,” Roberts said. “I think the whole time we thought we were going to have him back sooner, but then there’s a setback in the middle of spring and then with this. Technically it’s a setback, and I don’t know how severe the injury is.\"\\n\\nThe Dodgers\\' pitching staff has been bolstered by strong starts from rookies Kenta Maeda and Ross Stripling, who have combined to allow three earned runs and 15 hits in 25⅓ innings, but with Zack Greinke, last season\\'s MLB ERA champion, now pitching for the Arizona Diamondbacks, sizable holes remain in the rotation that Ryu could certainly fill.\\n\\n\"We need him back, but we need him back healthy,” Roberts said.\\n\\nRyu, who signed a six-year, $36 million contract prior to the 2013 season, was solid his first two seasons with the Dodgers. He posted a 14-8 mark and 3.00 ERA in 192 innings his first year and came back with a 14-7 record and 3.38 ERA in 152 innings in 2014, both years working as the No. 3 starter behind Clayton Kershaw and Greinke, who have combined for four Cy Young Awards. He was well on pace to reach 750 innings in the first five years of his contract and earn an opt-out clause after next season, when he’ll be 30 years old and still in the prime of his career.\\n\\nNow the Dodgers must continue down a path that has become all too familiar with Ryu, a road that seems to get longer and more circuitous by the day.', 'The Dodgers don\\'t know quite what to expect from Hyun-Jin Ryu this season, but the left-hander revealed Monday what he expects of himself.\\n\\nAs he prepared to catch a flight to Los Angeles, Ryu told reporters at Incheon International Airport in South Korea that he fully expects to be a part of the Dodgers rotation come opening day.\\n\\nRyu had shoulder surgery on his left labrum in May, and at least historically the return from such a surgery is something less than automatic. But his surgery did not include rotator cuff repair, dramatically increasing his chances for returning to form.\\n\\n\"My rehab has been going well and I\\'ve been taking each step without a problem,\" Ryu said, according to a report by the Yonhap News Agency. \"I think I should be able to get in good enough shape to be ready for spring training.\"', 'Hyun-Jin Ryu remains shut down as he works his way back from shoulder surgery.\\n\\nOn Friday, Dodgers Manager Dave Roberts said he expected Ryu to throw a bullpen session this weekend. But Saturday morning, Roberts indicated Ryu was still being held back. Roberts insisted “it’s definitely not a setback,” but part of the team’s long-term strategy.\\n\\n“There is no date [for Ryu to throw his next bullpen session],” Roberts said. “But the staff had a built-in, back-off period, where they can back off and then pick it up again. But there’s no date when he’s going to start throwing again.”\\n\\nWhen camp opened, the Dodgers said they expected Ryu to pitch in a Cactus League game. Ryu himself revealed his goals were to join the team in May, make 20 starts and log 150 innings. Those milestones become less and less likely as he remains idle.\\n\\nRyu experienced soreness in his left arm after throwing a bullpen session on Feb. 26. He has not thrown since. At some point in the future, Roberts explained, Ryu will resume his throwing program.', 'Forty-four days separate Hyun-Jin Ryu from the regular season, and for a man recovering from shoulder surgery, each day is fraught with peril.\\n\\nOn Thursday, as he watched Ryu complete a 35-pitch, \"low-intensity\" bullpen session, Dodgers Manager Dave Roberts wondered how Ryu would feel 24 hours later. Ryu alleviated those concerns on Friday when he relayed a lack of pain and the normal amount of soreness.\\n\\nTo approach a low-stakes affair like a light throwing session with such attention reveals the caution with which the Dodgers will handle Ryu this spring. The team intends to pitch him in Cactus League games and hopes he will break camp as a member of the starting rotation. But neither Roberts nor president of baseball operations Andrew Friedman could offer a timeline for Ryu\\'s return to normalcy.\\n\\n\"Emotionally, we all want him to be ready opening day,\" Friedman said during a lengthy session with reporters as the team\\'s pitchers and catchers reported to Camelback Ranch. \"He does. We do. It\\'s just, it\\'s important for us to do it the right way, and do it in in a way that when he comes back, he\\'s back for good.\"', 'GLENDALE, Ariz. ? Despite what could be as much as a week between bullpen sessions, recovering Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Hyun-Jin Ryu insisted Wednesday that he is not experiencing any kind of setback.\\n\\nRyu, who still is on the mend after shoulder surgery in May, last threw a bullpen session at Dodgers camp on Friday, his second bullpen of the spring. And he said he might not throw another one for another two days, minimum.\\n\\n“I’m just following all the steps, all the pace-by-pace and whatever they have planned,” Ryu said through an interpreter. “After the second bullpen session, this was the plan to rest, so I am just going along with that and I feel great.”\\n\\nRyu’s spring schedule already was at a more controlled pace than the rest of his healthy teammates. He isn’t expected back into the major league rotation until May, giving him a full year to recovery from his surgery.\\n\\n“There is definitely no pain,” he said. “Obviously after the bullpens, you have typical muscle soreness.”\\n\\nThe 26-year old is no rookie when it comes to rehabbing from surgery. He underwent a Tommy John procedure in 2004, while he was still in high school.\\n\\nAs for his current extended break between throwing sessions, Ryu characterized it as something that was expected.\\n\\n“I’m very happy and satisfied with the timetable they have given me,” he said. “They have given me time to rest and they have planned all this out. Whatever they had given I’m just pleased with that.\\n\\n“Even given the Tommy John surgery that I had before, there will be good times and bad times. You just have to ride it out.”', 'GLENDALE, Ariz. -- While the Los Angeles Dodgers are wrapping up spring training this week, Hyun-Jin Ryu is just starting his.\\n\\nManager Dave Roberts said Ryu will throw a final bullpen session Wednesday and then start facing hitters in live batting practice by the weekend.\\nThe left-hander, who had shoulder surgery last year, has been in camp ever since the Dodgers reported in February, but progressed slowly over the past month, even taking an extended break to combat soreness.\\n\\nAsked if Ryu is essentially on a spring training timetable now, when pitchers would transition to live BP once position players arrived in camp, Roberts said, “That’s fair.”\\n\\nA normal spring lasts six weeks, meaning that Ryu is about five weeks away from completing a typical preseason progression of bullpens, live BP and games every five days, while building a pitch count in each start.\\n\\nIt suggests that Ryu would be ready to pitch in games, without restrictions, by the second week of May.\\n\\nLeft unsaid is whether or not Ryu will pitch in minor league games after his spring training progression is complete, or if he would join the Dodgers then. He had originally been expected to return to the team in May, but his extended break at the start of March hinted at a June return.\\n\\nRyu is one of two Dodgers starting pitchers expected to return to the club before the All-Star break. Brandon McCarthy, who had Tommy John surgery last April, has an ambitious goal of making at least two starts for the Dodgers before the traditional mid-season break.', 'Starter Brett Anderson was revealed Thursday to be set to undergo back surgery and possibly miss half the season, one day after starter Hyun-Jin Ryu began experiencing discomfort in his surgically-repaired left shoulder.\\n\\nIs the Dodgers starting rotation in trouble heading into the 2016 season?\\n\\nWhile manager Dave Roberts said that Ryu\\'s discomfort wasn\\'t a setback and that his extra few days of rest is a precautionary measure, it\\'s still not a great sign for the left-hander, who didn\\'t pitch for the entire 2015 season. He also missed a number of starts in 2014 due to injury, so he\\'s taken the mound just 26 times in the past two years. \\n\\n\\nHe also dealt with what Roberts characterized as \"normal soreness\" during a bullpen session just over a week ago. The first-year manager said that Ryu is about two weeks behind the rest of the pitching staff.\\n\\nRyu said there\\'s \"definitely no pain\" and rather just \"typical soreness,\" but the left-hander underwent his shoulder procedure last May, so this could potentially be problematic, or at least further delay his 2016 debut. After all, the Korean admitted after his surgery that he was aware of the labrum tear in his shoulder ever since he underwent an MRI about two years prior, so it\\'s safe to say that the shoulder was more damaged since he pitched for that long while injured. \\n\\nWhile the Dodgers certainly prepared for the worst-case scenario in terms of their entire pitching staff by re-signing Anderson and adding Scott Kazmir and Kenta Maeda in free agency, another prolonged absence from Ryu is going to cost them dearly. The 28-year-old, despite making only 56 starts in two MLB seasons, was awfully impressive over that span, going 28-15 with a 3.17 ERA, 1.20 WHIP and 293 strikeouts in 344 innings. \\n\\n\\nAside from Kershaw, he\\'s arguably the next best pitcher/left-hander on the entire team.\\n\\nNow that Anderson and Brandon McCarthy will more than likely miss at least half the season, the Dodgers will rely on a number of relatively unproven arms in Maeda, Alex Wood, Mike Bolsinger, Zach Lee, Chris Anderson and Ross Stripling to potentially make an impact in the starting rotation.\\n\\nThis is the last thing that the club needed after losing Zack Greinke to the Arizona Diamondbacks, but there\\'s still plenty of time to assess the long-term health of Ryu as well as the potential of those looking to help out the MLB roster heading into 2016.', 'Ryu Hyun-jin (29), the Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher who is taking rehabilitation training after undergoing shoulder surgery, appeared before his home fans on Tuesday. Ryu joined his team at the team’s opening game at its home turf of the Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles. He returned to the team three months after having rehabilitation training in Glendale, Arizona from January.\\n“I am very happy to be back in Los Angeles. My rehabilitation training is proceeding smoothly. My shoulder is in good condition, and preparation is proceeding well,” he said on his second live pitching (pitching training by placing a batter) conducted on Tuesday, displaying self-confidence. “I am expected to do another live pitching training session, before taking the mound at an exercise game.” The number of pitches he throws at live pitching sessions is also gradually increasing.\\nHis team did not release Ryu’s detailed schedule going forward. However, considering that Ryu mentioned an exercise game, watchers predict that he could return to games before early June, a timeline U.S. media had forecast. Ryu, who was seen having his mustache grown wild because he could not have his hair cut during rehabilitation training, headed to a barbershop after the media interview.', 'Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Ryu Hyun-jin left a training camp in Glendale, Arizona on Tuesday and rejoined the team. \\n\\n\"I returned to Los Angeles for the first time in three months,\" he said. \\n\\nRyu had surgery on his left shoulder last season and started the new season on the disabled list, staying in the training camp to focus on rehabilitation. \\n\\nIf everything goes well as planned, he will be able to make a return to the big league in mid-May or June.', 'Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Ryu Hyun-jin (29), who is taking rehabilitation training after surgery, might have a setback in his schedule of returning to the mound. \"I think the whole time we thought we were going to have him back sooner, but there was a setback early in spring, middle of spring,” Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said.\\nIt is the first time that Ryu has complained of pain in his body other than the shoulder that he underwent surgery in May last year. Watchers say it is rather fortunate that his pain is not in his shoulder.

The Indians made an aggressive bid to win the negotiating rights to South Korean first baseman Byung-ho Park last week, but lost out to the Twins. ESPN reported the Twins\\' winning bid was $12.85 million, but they must sign the right-handed power hitter within 30 days.\\n\\nThe miss on Park did not knock the Indians out of the Korean market. They have interest in right-hander Seung-hwan Oh, who is scheduled to visit the United States this week to talk to several big-league clubs.

Without these three players, the Samsung Lions went on to lose the Korean Series to the Doosan Bears.\\n\\nAccording to testimony, Lim utilized a relationship with a local gang member to secure VIP gambling experiences in Macau, as well as the Phillipines.\\n\\nIt is not clear that any concrete evidence has linked Oh to the gambling operation, although news of Oh\\'s possible involvement arose only after prosecutors at the Seoul Central District Prosecutors\\' Office reportedly secured a list of people who frequented the casinos in Macau.\\n\\nThe next step for the prosecution is to investigate whether Oh and Lim acted together, although a date for Oh\\'s summons is not yet set. Oh\\'s agent stated via press release:\\n\\n\"Oh is at a critical point of signing a new contract with a Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB) or an MLB team and he wants to clear suspicions as soon as possible.

Our own Jeff Passan called him the \"Mariano Rivera of Korea\" in his free-agent rankings. \\n\\nIf that wasn\\'t enough, the longtime closer is nicknamed \"The Final Boss,\" according to MLB Trade Rumors. That has to be one of the best nicknames around, and it\\'s particularly fitting for a closer. \\n\\nBased on his numbers from the KBO and the NPB, we would expect major-league teams to show plenty of interest in Oh. In nine seasons in Korea and two in Japan, Oh has compiled a 1.81 ERA. He\\'s coming off a season with the Hanshin Tigers in which he had a 2.76 ERA and 41 saves. He struck out 66 batters in 69 1/3 innings.\\n\\nProvided a team is willing to bite on those impressive credentials, it appears \"The Final Boss\" will bring his talent to Major League Baseball next year.\\n\\nThe whole thing reminds us of a video game. You fight so hard over the course of the game to beat various enemies. The earlier enemies and bosses are easy enough, but then you reach the final inning ... or level in this scenario.

For this reason, KBO picked their ?return to the KBO league? as the timing from which their punishment will take effect. As a result, if the two players join Korean baseball teams within this season, they will not be allowed to play as a player in not only the primary league but also the secondary league in 72 games from the time they register as players with KBO. Each team is set to play a total of 144 games during the regular season this year.\\nAs the severity of punishment for the two players has been announced, attention is now focusing on their course of actions going forward. Notably, unlike Oh Seung-hwan, who is preparing to move to the U.S. Major League Baseball, whether Lim, who still boasts of robust capacity as a closing pitcher, will return to the mound or not has become a ?hot potato.? A source at KBO said, ?Public opinion is not so positive. Teams will find it difficult to recruit (Lim Chang-yong) even by damaging their own image.?\\nThe decision by KBO will likely serve as a yardstick for gauging the severity of punishment for Ahn Ji-man and Yoon Seong-hwan from Samsung, who are still under police investigation for the same charges. Yang Hae-young, secretary general of KBO said, ?We cannot comment because investigation is still underway (on Ahn Ji-man and Yoon Seong-hwan). However, if they are given legal punishment similar to that for Lim Chang-yong and Oh Seung-hwan, they will be handed a similar degree of penalty by KBO as well.?', \"Baseball player Oh Seung-hwan risks losing his Japanese contract if he is prosecuted for illegal gambling overseas. \\n\\nHanshin Tigers said Thursday it would terminate the contract with the player if he is charged.

There was no posting fee due to Oh being a free agent. That was January 11, 2016. \\n\\nAfter the signing, Oh had to return to his native country to face charges of gambling, an entertainment which South Korea holds strict laws against for native South Koreans. There is only one domestic casino; and, large betting amounts are not allowed. However, there are 16 casino\\'s for foreigners only. Oh, along with former Chicago Cubs pitcher Lim Chang-yong and Oh\\'s former teammate, were charged under South Korean law. Oh was fined 10 million for betting heavily, a fine equal to $8,300 in the United States. Per the article from FoxSports.com - \"The Korean Baseball Organization earlier hit both players with half-season bans after prosecutors charged them for betting around 40 million won ($33,000) each at a casino in Macau in 2014.\" The ban imposed was for games played in South Korea only. Thus, Oh traveled to Japan to continue his career.\\n\\nAlong with taking care of his court fine, he awaited approval of his work visa, to return to the States. Finally, this past mid-week with visa in hand, OH and his agent along with a friend, arrived at Roger Dean Stadium yesterday. He joined in the informal workouts with the rest of the Cardinals early arrivals. That was after he had stepped off his flight of 14 1/2 hours. \\n\\nAfter his workout, he was asked about his familiarity being in the States. He stated that it was familiar simply because it was baseball.

I don\\'t believe, if I were the opposition, I would take 33 year old Oh for granted either. ', \"Heading into this season, everybody knew that the Cardinals would have a very good bullpen. With returning faces like Kevin Seigrist, Seth Maness, Trevor Rosenthal, and Jonathan Broxton, most experts knew that there are very few teams who can compete with the Cardinals in terms of bullpen production.\\n\\n\\nHowever, surprisingly, or not that surprising to Korean baseball fans, in the first month of the season, Seung-hwan Oh has emerged as one of the most reliable pitchers in this bullpen behind Rosenthal and Seigrist.\\n\\nIn 9 & 2/3 innings this year, which leads pitchers in the bullpen, Oh is 1-0 with a 1.86 ERA and 16 strikeouts. More impressively, he has a 0.93 WHIP.\\n\\nOne of the best traits for a quality relief pitcher is that he doesn't let the ball get put in play a lot and simply strikes out the batter, alleviating the pressure from the defense behind him. With the Cardinals having an especially weak defense behind him, what Oh is doing is even more impressive.\\nOh's strikeout percentage is probably the most fascinating. Having faced 37 batters this year, he has 16 strikeouts, giving him a 43% strikeout rate.\\n\\nWith the exception of his blemish in that marathon Cubs game after the long rain delay in which he gave up two runs (both runs came after Matt Adams missed a diving ground ball), Oh has been perfect on the season. He is also pitching in high pressure situations. In the nine games he pitched this year, six of them were in a game decided by 3 or less runs.\\n\\nOh adds his value to the bullpen as a very flexible pitcher who Manager Mike Matheny can count on in many different situations. Recently, in a game against the Cincinnati Reds, Oh pitched for 2 innings and didn't show any signs of fatigue, showing that he can eat innings up for the bullpen if need be. He has also pitched in the 8th inning role holding a lead for Rosenthal.\\n\\nOf course, the season is still young and we don't have enough statistics to truly tell how a pitcher will be in this league, especially one who has pitched in a different country for his entire career. However, with that being said, Oh has looked terrific. If he keeps up this level of success, General Manger John Mozeliak hit a homerun with this offseason signing.\", 'Cardinals set-up man Seung-Hwan Oh shut the Twins down in one inning on Monday, allowing no hits and striking out one - fellow countryman Byung-Ho Park.\\n\\nFantasy Impact: It was a nice start for Oh who should be a lock for the Cardinals setup role to closer Trevor Rosenthal.

He has struck out 27 times in 79 at-bats, which is something he will have to improve upon to succeed in the MLB.\", 'It was announced today by Daniel Kim of KBS Sports that the Minnesota Twins had placed the winning bid of $12.85 million to negotiate with power-hitting Korean first baseman Byung-Ho Park, who hit .343 with 53 home runs and 146 RBI playing for the Nexen Heroes last season. However, though the 29-year-old has talent, he won’t solve the Twins’ greater problems and, assuming that a deal can be struck between both parties in the next 30 days, will be a mere band-aid solution.\\n\\nFrom a money standpoint, submitting a bid for Park isn’t a bad decision on Minnesota’s part by any stretch of the imagination. Without factoring contracts that have yet to be determined via arbitration, the team’s payroll for next season is currently at $73 million, per Spotrac. It was at $106 million in 2015, well below the luxury tax threshold, and there is little to suggest that there will be a significant rise in it come 2016. In the case of Park, if no deal is struck, Minnesota gets it’s $12.85 million refunded and Park heads back to Nexen for next season. No harm, no foul. Long story short, the team can afford him.\\n\\nBut though Park could indeed be of a great help to a Twins’ team that went 83-79 in 2015, each win costing just under $1.3 million, he wouldn’t solve Minnesota’s problems overnight. The Twins tied for 12th in MLB with 696 runs scored, but ranked 26th with a team batting average of just .247 and 28th in on-base percentage (OBP) at just .305. Minnesota also ranked 18th with a team slugging percentage of .399 and 16th with 156 home runs.\\n\\nMuch of those numbers above can be attributed to Target Field, the Twins’ $545 million ($589 million in 2015) stadium that opened in 2010, putting an end to nearly three decades of Twins baseball at the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome. Consider this. In 2009, the Twins’ final year at the Metrodome, the team ranked third in batting average, 13th in home runs, fifth in OBP and ninth in slugging percentage en route to the AL Central Division crown. The following year, though the team made the playoffs again, Minnesota dipped to 19th in home runs, but stayed third in batting average and improved to second in OBP and seventh in slugging. Though improved, the dip in power was indicative that Target Field was not at all a hitter’s park the same way the Metrodome was, with only five players hitting double figures in home runs compared to six in 2009.\\n\\nWhich brings the conversation to the next point: despite Park’s talent, first base is currently occupied in Minnesota by three-time batting champion and former AL MVP Joe Mauer. Going back to 2009, local hero Mauer was the player fans came to see in Minnesota. That year, despite missing nearly a month of action to start the season, he led MLB with a .365 batting average while also slugging 28 home runs with 96 RBI as he manned the catcher’s spot. Teammate Justin Morneau handled first base and hit .274 with 30 home runs and 100 RBI, and it was expected that the two would continue to put up top production in the new stadium.', \"There have been a number of things that been underwhelming about the start of 2016 for the Minnesota Twins ? the 0-9 start, Miguel Sano's .216 batting average and all things Byron Buxton.\\nBut one thing that hasn't underwhelmed is Korean rookie Byung-ho Park's ability to hit massive home runs. Park ? a 29-year-old who hit 50+ the past two seasons in Korea ? hasn't had the smoothest transition into MLB, which isn't all that uncommon. He's still hitting just .233. But things have been better lately. He had four hits in the last two games, including a homer in each game.\\n\\n[Join a Yahoo Daily Fantasy Baseball contest now]\\n\\nYou can see if Park can hit another on Thursday when the Twins play the Milwaukee Brewers.

His first homer of the season was measured at 466 feet by ESPN's Hit Tracker Online (the second longest of the season thus far). MLB's Statcast system had it at 451.

Unlike most other sluggers who tend to swing inwardly, Park hit 49, or 29 percent of the 220 homers that he hit in the Korean pro league, through rightward pushy swings.\\nWith the homer, Park has solidified not only his No. 1 spot in homers in his team but also the top place in homers among the rookie players in the American League. The second-ranked player in homers among the rookie players in the American League is Tylor White (five).\\n“The more I take the batter’s box in games and I check pitchers’ pitches, the more lesson I learn,\" Park said. \"I gain self-confidence all the more when I take the batter’s box.”', 'Minnesota Twins\\' Korean slugger Park Byung-ho had his third homer of the season in a home game against The Milwaukee Brewers of the Major League Baseball, which took place at the Minneapolis Target Field in Minnesota on Monday local time.\\nIt was an exciting homer he celebrated \"Park Byung-ho Day,\" which he added two days after hitting an ultra-long-distance homer with a flying distance of 140.8 meters that he garnered in the game against the Los Angeles Angels on Sunday.\\nAs the sixth batter and designated hitter, Park took the batter’s box as the first batter in the bottom of the fourth inning, with the score tying 3-3. He hit a 119-meter solo homer that struck the top section of the advertising board in the right-side spectators’ stand off the opponent team’s starting pitcher Chase Anderson.

When he hit two previous homers, he swung on sliders, but he swung on a 90-mile fastball on the day.\\nAfter a double play and homer in the second and fourth innings, respectively, Park had a hit in the bottom of the fifth inning to post multiple hits for the first time since his big league debut. He also elevated his batting average to the .2 level (.205) for this season. The game was declared as \"called game\" due to rain in the top of the seventh inning. Minnesota won 7-4.\\nThe day was designated as \"Park Byung-ho Balcony Day\" by Minnesota. To entertain fans who rooted for Park, his team installed \"Park Byung-ho Balcony\" or designated seats for cheering him on the day. Fans who were sittng in the seats were granted a cap marked with \"Minnesota Twins\" in Korean alphabet as a gift. The team also sold Korean beer and kimchi balls made of kimchi. Park Byung-ho Balcony, which was put in place on the second floor of the spectators’ stand around the third base area, was so popular that tickets for the section were all sold out.\\nPark Byung-ho also received in person the opening pitching thrown by Shin Hak-cheol, Korean American and senior vice chairman of multinational company 3M. “Many Korean Americans (living in Minnesota) came to see the game, and it would have been embarrassing if I performed poorly,\" Park said after the game. \"It was fortunate that I performed well and our team won the game. I am so grateful to the team for giving a chance to a new face.”\\nMeanwhile, Kang Jung-ho (29) of the Pittsburgh Orioles played in a real game as a member of Triple A for the first time since suffering an injury in September last year.

Mauer also is a sizzling .429 (6-for-14) against lefties this season.\\n\\nBut if Park can\\'t play now, when can he?

His ERA now sits at 1.84.\", 'Byung Ho Park hit a home run against the Brewers last week in the series opener.\\nByung Ho Park watched a Cody Anderson four-seamer blaze past at 94 mph during the second inning Tuesday night, and got a read on its speed. After watching a curveball spin too low, he waited for the 1-1 pitch. Another fastball, virtually identical to the first, and Park was ready: He whipped his bat into the pitch and drove it deep to right-center field, arriving at second base with a leadoff double.\\n\\nA few minutes later, Park scored on a Kurt Suzuki single to give the Twins a 2-1 lead. It was a good sequence for the offense-challenged Twins, but also represented a minor milestone for the 29-year-old Korean: his first major league hit off an extreme-velocity pitch, something that’s becoming more common every year in Major League Baseball.\\n\\nMost scouting reports on Park, as he left South Korea to sign with the Twins last winter, noted his extraordinary power, his impressive bat speed ? and his inexperience against pitchers who throw in the mid-90s and above. Few pitchers in the Korea Baseball Organization, where Park hit 104 homers over the past two seasons, can hurl a fastball more than 90 mph.\\n\\nSo how is the transition to MLB levels of speed going? Well, it’s been a predictably slow start, but the Twins are heartened by their rookie’s progress.\\n\\n“I don’t know if I’d comment specifically on how he’s handling hard stuff ? it’s just that I see steady improvement, whether it’s on fastballs or breaking balls,” manager Paul Molitor said. “We’ve seen him hammer breaking-ball mistakes, but he hit a fastball away for a no-doubter [home run] to right field [on April 18]. He’s pulled some good fastballs.”\\n\\nPark has left little doubt that he can crush slower-speed breaking balls that hang in the strike zone. The South Korean leads the Twins with five home runs, including a couple that traveled more than 440 feet, and three of them came on sliders or curves traveling less than 80 mph. Wednesday’s cannon shot that pulled the Twins within a run of the Indians was off an 84-mph cutter. Only that opposite-field blast off Chase Anderson, the homer that particularly impressed Molitor, came on a fastball, timed at 90 mph.\\n\\n“Not necessarily am I trying to hit home runs off a hard fastball. It’s all about timing,” Park said through an interpreter. “Once you reach it, you can’t control where it goes. So I work on my timing as much as I can against the 95 mph fastballs. I would say I feel comfortable now.”\\n\\nProbably even better after Tuesday’s double. According to MLB’s pitchf/x data, Park has faced 60 pitches of extreme velocity (93 mph and above) this season. Of those, he has taken 16 for balls, 11 for strikes, and fouled off 17. He has swung and missed at only six. But of the 10 hard fastballs he has put into play, only that double off Anderson fell in for a hit.\\n\\nBy contrast, teammate Brian Dozier, even with a batting average of only .207, leads the majors in hits against 93 mph-plus fastballs, with nine. Miguel Sano owns seven, Eduardo Escobar six, and every Twins position player had at least one before Park. But four of Park’s 14 total hits have come on four-seam or two-seam fastballs timed at 90 or above.\\n\\n“I think everyone is kind of learning he’s a little bit of a guess guy. If he’s looking to hit a good fastball, he’s got the bat speed to do it,” Molitor said. “He’s jumped on breaking balls when he’s gotten mistakes, too.”\\n\\nPark agrees with his manager’s observation.\\n\\n“I wouldn’t say I’m a fastball hitter or a breaking-ball hitter, but more of my home runs [in South Korea] came on fastballs,” Park said. “Not all, but some I was sitting on a breaking ball because of the situation and the pitcher. That has happened here, too.”', 'The Twins have had their eye on the South Korean slugger since high school, and judging by his recent 462-foot blast to center field, their instincts were right. After a slow start, Park seems to be adapting to American baseball, and its faster pitching.\\n\\nLongtime friend J.D. Kim is Park’s translator.\\n\\n“I’m not going to lie, it’s not easy making those transitions seamless,” Park said, according to translator Kim. “And I didn’t expect it to be easy. Like you said, it’s a big transition. It’s a great feeling and really relieving to know that your coaching staff and your teammates are supporting you, regardless of how well or poorly you’re doing.”\\n\\n\\nOff the field, Park’s been busy getting his wife and toddler son settled in the Twin Cities, checking out the sites and figuring out how to get around town.\\n\\nHe’s getting to know his teammates too, clubhouse antics and all.\\n\\n“I can definitely sense that everybody in this clubhouse is trying not to make me feel alone here,” Park said via Kim. “They’re trying to make jokes around me, trying to make conversation. And when we’re on the road, they ask me if I want to go out to dinner, get something to eat, so I really appreciate that.”\\n\\nOne night at spring training, some of the guys even had him over to watch an episode of the Bachelor ? something Park rolls his eyes at and says he’ll never understand.', 'SEOUL, April 12 (Yonhap) -- Now that South Korea have found out who their opponents will be in the final Asian qualifying round for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, here comes the real task: finishing inside the top two in their group to grab a ticket to Russia.\\n\\nIn the draw for the final round in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, on Tuesday, South Korea were paired with Iran, Uzbekistan, China, Qatar and Syria in Group A.\\n\\nIt\\'s perhaps not the best case scenario that fans had hoped, but by avoiding a slew of tough Middle Eastern nations, South Korea seem to be well-positioned to qualify for their ninth consecutive World Cup.\\n\\nFor the final round, twelve nations were drawn into two groups of six teams to play home-and-away under the round-robin format. The top two countries from each group will directly qualify for the 2018 World Cup in Russia, while the third-place teams from the two groups will have to go through playoffs to book their spot at the tournament.\\n\\nSouth Korea will obviously try to qualify as among the top two teams in the group, for finishing third will mean some pressure-packed matches down the road.\\n\\nThe two No. 3 seeds will have to go through a two-legged playoff round, with the winner going on to meet the fourth-place team from the fifth qualifying round in the Confederation of North, Central American and Caribbean Association Football (CONCACAF). The two-legged inter-confederation playoff is also home-and-away and will be played in November 2017.\\n\\nThough they receive one of the two top seeds for the draw, South Korea are still considered favorites to punch their ticket to the World Cup along with Iran out of Group A, based on their head-to-head records against other teams and their performances in the previous round.\\n\\nSouth Korea have marched into the final round as the Group G winner with a flawless record of eight straight wins, which also includes a 3-0 forfeit victory over Kuwait.\\n\\nSouth Korea, led by head coach Uli Stielike, are the only Asian Football Confederation (AFC) member to win all second round matches without surrendering a goal. They scored 24 goals and conceded none in the seven matches played, not counting the forfeited match versus Kuwait.\\n\\nAmong the opponents in Group A in the final round, Iran could present the biggest challenge for South Korea. The four-time World Cup participant ranked first in Group D in the previous round with six wins and two draws.\\n\\nSouth Korea have posted nine wins, seven draws and 12 losses against Iran, and have suffered 1-0 losses in each of their last three meetings. Their last encounter was in November 2014 in Tehran where South Korea fell 1-0 to the hosts.\\n\\nIn particular, South Korea have never won on Iranian soil, with two losses and four draws.\\n\\n\"It\\'s time for us to come back home with a good result in Tehran,\" Stielike said on Tuesday.\\n\\nIran also have several players who are playing or have played in Europe. Reza Ghoochannejhad of Charton Athletic and Sardar Azmoun of Rostov are considered the two dangerous forwards on whom South Korea should keep their eyes.\\n\\nSouth Korea have winning records against all the other nations in the group, raising their possibility to finish inside the top two.\\n\\nUzbekistan, ranked 66th, topped Group H in the previous round with seven wins and a loss. Their only blemish was a 4-2 loss to North Korea in Pyongyang.\\n\\nSouth Korea have collected nine wins, three draws and one loss against Uzbekistan. Their only defeat dates back to 1994. And South Korea also have never lost to Uzbekistan in the final World cup qualifying round, with four wins and two draws.\\n\\nUzbekistan have players who are familiar to the South Korean football fans. Veteran midfielder Server Djeparov, the 2008 and 2011 Asian Footballer of the Year, played for three different South Korean clubs before returning to his homeland club this year, while forward Alexander Geynrikh previously played with Suwon Samsung Bluewings here.\\n\\nThree other teams are expected to pose little threat to South Korea.\\n\\nQatar, ranked 83rd, joined the final round as the Group C winner with seven wins and a loss. The Taeguk Warriors have four wins, two draws and a loss against the hosts for the 2022 FIFA World Cup and have not lost since 1988.\\n\\nStielike should be familiar with Qatari players as he coached Qatari clubs for nearly seven years before taking over South Korea in September 2014.\\n\\nChina, ranked 81st, are looking for their first World Cup appearance since 2002. In the second round, they finished second in Group C behind Qatar with five wins, two draws and a loss.\\n\\nSouth Koreans have been also dominant against the Chinese, losing only once in their 30 meetings while collecting 17 wins and 12 draws. Their latest meeting was in August last year at the East Asian Football Federation (EAFF) East Asian Cup, where South Korea blanked China 2-0.\\n\\nSyria are 110th on the FIFA rankings, second lowest in the final round ahead of only Thailand. They were the runner-up in Group E behind Japan after marking six wins and two losses.\\n\\nSouth Korea have played Syria only six times and they have three wins, two draws and a loss. They last squared off against each other in 2010, when South Korea won 1-0.\\n\\nSouth Korea should seek to score as many goals as they can against Syria, which let in 11 goals in the second round, the most among nations qualified for the final round.\\n\\nThe tight match schedule could present more challenges to Stielike\\'s side than actual opponents.\\n\\nSouth Korea first host China on Sept. 1 before traveling to Syria five days later. They will then face Qatar at home on Oct. 6 and go to Iran five days later to play what could be the most difficult match in the final round.\\n\\n\"We need to collect points before going to Iran,\" Stielike said. \"It\\'s important for us to not have big pressure before playing the match against Iran.\"\\n\\n   South Korea will wrap up the first half of the final round by hosting Uzbekistan on Nov. 15. The second half will start on March 23, 2017, when they travel to China. South Korea\\'s last match is at Uzbekistan on Sept. 5 next year.\\n\\nTuning up for the final round, South Korea will take on Spain on June 1 in Salzburg, Austria, and face the Czech Republic on June 5 in Prague.\\n\\n\"We have been waiting to have matches against high-ranked European teams,\" he said. \"It\\'s important for us to show that our performances in last 15 months are not flukes by collecting good results against Spain and the Czech Republic.\"\\n\\n   Stielike is mostly concerned about players based in Europe who are struggling to get playing time with their clubs.\\n\\nNational team captain and core midfielder Ki Sung-yueng played only three matches last month and has yet to feature in a single game this month for his English club Swansea City. Tottenham Hotspur forward Son Heung-min has contributed little to his second-place club in the English Premier League.\\n\\nBut their situation may be better than players like Lee Chung-yong, who has failed to feature for Crystal Palace since a match against Watford on Feb. 14.\\n\\nTwo left backs in the German Bundesliga have been also silent. Kim Jin-su of Hoffenheim hasn\\'t played a match since Feb. 1 and Park Joo-ho of Borussia Dortmund was last seen on the pitch on Jan. 24.\\n\\nIn addition, FC Augsburg forward Ji Dong-won has been out of action since Feb. 22 after picking up a right thigh injury. But his teammates Koo Ja-cheol and Hong Jeong-ho have been playing well of late. Elsewhere, striker Suk Hyun-joon has been regularly playing for his Portuguese club FC Porto.\\n\\n\"Some players may be on the move during the summer transfer window in July and August,\" he said. \"What\\'s important is that they need to be back on the pitch and play matches regularly.\"', 'Koo scored three hat tricks against Leverkusen at a home game on Saturday. He scored the opening goal at fifth minute in the first half, before scoring another at 44th minute in the first, and the third at 12th minute in the second. It is the first time that Koo achieved hat tricks as a professional player who moved to Germany in the 2010-2011 season after joining the Jeju United of the K-League in 2007. He is also the second Korean to secure a hat trick in the Bundesliga after Son Heung-min who played for Bayer Leverkusen back in 2013.\\nKoo also had the joy of posting his individual record of overall goals scored in a regular season with seven goals. His previous record was five goals that he posted in the 2011-2012 season at Augsburg and the last season at Mainz.\\nAs Augsburg has nine matches to play in the regular season, Koo has a strong chance to record double-digit goals.

Except for Koo, no other players even won a score at the eight point level.\\nAugsburg, however, failed to keep its lead, ending the game tying 3-3. “I feel shame that my hat tricks were not sufficient to enable our team to secure three score points. Since our team did not win the match, I cannot afford to celebrate my goals,” Koo said at an interview after the match, expressing regret over the game’s outcome.', 'Augsburg are currently fourth from bottom with a points total of 30 thanks to a record of seven wins and nine draws, they are only three points clear of the drop zone.\\n\\nThey managed to snap a run of six matches without a victory when they defeated Werder Bremen 2-1 last Saturday with Alfreo Finnbogason and Jeong-Ho-Hong getting on the score sheet.\\n\\nStuttgart, on the other hand, are 12th on the league standings and need the points themselves because they not quite safe yet.\\n\\nTheir last win in the Bundesliga took place on March 5 when they ran out 5-1 winners against Hoffenheim with Georg Niedermeier grabbing a brace of goals.\\n\\nSince that win they have drawn two and lost two and come into this weekend’s clash on the back of a 3-1 home defeat at the hands of league leaders Bayern Munich.\\n\\nThese two have already met this season with Augsburg running out 4-0 winners at the Mercedes-Benz-Arena with Alexander Esswein, Jan-Ingwer Callsen-Bracker and Ja-Cheol Koo getting on the score sheet along with an own-goal from Timo Baumgartl.\\n\\nAugsburg versus Stuttgart takes place at the WWK Arena on Saturday, April 16 with a kick-off time of 1430 BST.

They go into their game with Stuttgart with just 1 win in their last 6 games, but that win came in their most recent game, a 2-1 win away at Werder Bremen. They will want to build on that result this weekend against Stuttgart. Midfielder Ja-Cheol Koo leads their scoring with 8 league goals, and will hope to get on the scoresheet again this weekend.\\n\\nStuttgart will be trying to stay away from the relegation fight this weekend, sitting 12th in the table. They head to Augsburg on the back of just 1 win in their last 6 games in the league, with their most recent game being a 3-1 defeat at home to leaders Bayern Munich.

Head coach Uli Stielike previously said he wants to form the strongest team possible with players in top form.\\n\\nHowever, Choi said that Koo will be available for South Korea when the final Asian qualifying round for the 2018 FIFA World Cup begins in September. He added that the former Wolfsburg and Mainz midfielder has just injured a toe, not an ankle, which had been bothering Koo in recent years.\\n\\nKoo has scored eight goals in 27 matches for Augsburg this season, setting a career-high for a single Bundesliga season. He had seven goals last season with Mainz.', \"Koo Ja-cheol scored the first hat trick of his professional career in Augsburg's home match against Bayer Leverkusen on Saturday.\\n\\nKoo's fifth, sixth and seventh goals of the season took him to a new personal best for a Bundesliga season. Koo, whose career in Germany started with Wolfsburg in 2010, had never previously scored more than five goals in a season.\\n\\nKoo is the second Korean to score a hat track in a Bundesliga match, after former Leverkusen player Son Heung-min, who did it twice before transferring to Tottenham Hotspur in the English Premier League. Korean Bundesliga legend Cha Bum-kun never scored a hat trick while playing in Germany.\\n\\nKoo's first goal came just five minutes into the game, when he netted a rebound after Alexander Esswein's shot hit the post. In the 44th minute, he scored off another goalpost rebound, this time off a shot by Alfreð Finnbogason. Still looking lively in the second half, Koo's 57th-minute volley off Finnbogason's chest found the back of the net to complete the hat trick.\\n\\nAugsburg threw away their 3-0 lead, however, allowing Leverkusen to score twice in the second half and surrendering a penalty just before the full time whistle to end the game in a 3-3 draw.\", 'Many of the top Korean footballers playing in Europe have been sidelined in recent matches, causing concerns ahead of September\\'s final Asian qualification round for the 2018 World Cup in Russia, as they are key players in the Korean national team.\\n\\nNational team manager Uli Stielike recently told reporters it would be difficult to include players who have not had time on the pitch for over six months on the team\\'s roster. \\n\\nLee Chung-yong of Crystal Palace and Ki Sung-yueng of Swansea City in the English Premier League made just one appearance each in April.\\n\\nIn a recent interview with a Korean media outlet, Lee complained about being overlooked by Crystal Palace manager Alan Pardew since recovering from a knee injury. \"I don\\'t have any reason to stay here next season,\" he said.\\n\\nMidfielder Ki, named Swansea\\'s player of the year last season after scoring eight goals, was brought on briefly as a sub in last week\\'s game against Leicester City, but has otherwise rarely left the bench of late. Francesco Guidolin, the team\\'s new manager, has shown a preference for defensive midfielders over attacking midfielders like Ki.\\n\\n\\nSon Heung-min of Tottenham Hotspur appeared in four matches in April but started in only one of them, seemingly overlooked in favor of his main rivals in midfield, Dele Alli and Erik Lamela. Alli and Lamela have made big contributions to the team\\'s current second-place position in the league, scoring 11 and 10 goals respectively.\\n\\n\\nIn the Bundesliga, Park Joo-ho of Dortmund and Kim Jin-su of Hoffenheim have both been sidelined since February. Striker Suk Hyun-jun has struggled to find form since joining prestigious Portuguese club FC Porto in January, managing just one goal in his last 10 matches.\\n\\n\\nKoo Ja-cheol of Bundesliga side Augsburg is the only Korean player currently shining in a European league. Starting in all four matches in April, Koo has made a strong impact in each. Teammates Hong Jeong-ho and Ji Dong-won have been used as substitutes.', 'SEOUL, Nov. 13 (Yonhap) ? When South Korea try to extend their winning streak in the regional World Cup qualification against Laos next Tuesday, they will have to do so without midfielder Koo Ja-cheol.\\n\\nKoo has been ruled ineligible for the upcoming Group G match in the second round of the Asian qualification for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, after picking up his second yellow card in as many qualifiers against Myanmar Thursday. He will instead rejoin his Bundesliga club, FC Augsburg.\\n\\nKoo headed in South Korea’s second goal in their 4-0 win at Suwon World Cup Stadium in Suwon, Gyeonggi Province.\\n\\nThe Korea Football Association (KFA) said no replacement will be named for the midfielder, who has scored 16 times in 51 international matches.\\n\\nEven without Koo, the 48th-ranked South Korea should have little trouble against Laos, ranked 176th. In their previous meeting in September, South Korea routed Laos 8-0, with winger Son Heung-min scoring a hat trick.\\n\\nSouth Korea remain atop the group with a perfect 5-0-0 record, having scored 18 goals and allowed none. For the year, South Korea have won 15, drawn three and lost only one ? to Australia at the AFC Asian Cup final in January.\\n\\nA victory over Laos will give South Korea their most victories in a calendar year since 1980.', 'South Korea\\'s Koo Ja Cheol said it felt good to be back home with the Augsburg, as he signed a two-year deal on Tuesday.

Koo will join the rest of Augsburg team on Thursday for their Russia 2018 qualifiers.\\n\\n\\n ', 'The dust has settled on the draw for the 2018 World Cup for South Korea. Coach Uli Stielike knows exactly which teams they will face ― China, Iran, Qatar, Uzbekistan and Syria ― and when: it all starts on September 1, 2016, and ends September 5, 2017. Now he has to start thinking about his team.\\n\\nHis mission is simple: to finish in the top two in the group and as this is the World Cup, the boss will want to field his strongest team in every game. Some of the team\\'s best are in Europe.\\n\\nThere is the English Premier League trio of captain Ki Sung-yueng at Swansea City, Lee Chung-yong at Crystal Palace and Son Heung-min at Tottenham Hotpsur. There are more in Germany: Park Joo-ho at Borussia Dortmund, Hong Jeong-ho, Koo Ja-cheol and Ji Dong-won at Augsburg and Kim Jin-soo with Hoffenheim.\\n\\nMost of those would expect to be selected for the national team if fit but the coach has warned the Euro-stars that it won\\'t be so easy. He has told them that only those who play regularly for their clubs will be considered.\\n\\nAt the moment, that applies to few. None of the English-based stars are doing so. Ki was Swansea\\'s player of the season last time but injuries and the club\\'s struggles have seen him lose his regular-starter status. Son at Spurs is usually on the bench while Lee at Palace often struggles to get that close to the field.\\n\\nIn Germany, only Koo and Hong play often, with Ji injured and the two left backs, Park and Kim, not having played for a couple of months.\\n\\nObviously, players who aren\\'t regularly on the field can lose their form and sharpness. The ideal situation is for the overseas stars to play every week at a high level. It is better to be playing in the K-League than benched in the Premier League. Stielike is hopeful that some will move teams after the European season ends.\\n\\n\"I am curious how they will turn out in transfers this summer,\" he told reporters at Incheon International Airport after returning from the draw. \"I have some expectations that those players (who are not playing regularly) may have more opportunities in new teams. It is very important for them to play regularly.\\n\\n\"I think calling up players who have not played as regular members for about six months to the World Cup squad wouldn\\'t be appropriate.\"\\n\\nThe problem is an old one and every coach for South Korea has said a similar thing since Koreans started going to Europe in any kind of number. The promise or threat goes that players who rarely play in England or Germany will not play for Korea. It sounds reasonable, but when it comes down to it, no coach follows it up. If Stielike does, he will be the first.\\n\\nHe is also being a little disingenuous. Not only can the coach decide what constitutes regular, but he will be naming his roster for the first two games, against China at home and Qatar away, in mid-August when the European season is just starting. Nobody will have played.\\n\\nSix months after the start of the new season, when his deadline is looming, half the qualification games will already have been played. If results are good, nobody will care and there will no calls to change a winning Korean team. If results are poor, there will be pressure to change anyway.\\n\\nEven so, it is hard to imagine Ki, the captain and heartbeat of the team, or Son, its biggest star, being left out of any roster because they have not been playing regularly. It is unlikely to happen, appropriate or not.

'Sunderland face their second away game in the space of 72 hours tomorrow lunchtime, when the Black Cats look to build on back-to-back Premier League wins over fellow strugglers Aston Villa and Swansea, by adding to their points tally at fourth placed Spurs.\\n\\nAllardyce’s men travelled to London yesterday after a recovery session at their base in Cardiff and will participate in light training at QPR today, before the players face a video analysis session on the Spurs squad.\\n\\nBut while Sunderland’s medical team have been understandably cautious over fatigue levels, Allardyce believes the players will feel much fresher after the 4-2 victory at Swansea moved the Black Cats to within a point of the safety mark.\\n\\nAllardyce said: “Placebo-wise, we feel good now.\\n\\n“We don’t feel as tired after we’ve won, as we would have done if we’d lost.\\n\\n“We’ve got a bit of training today at QPR and the rest of it will be visually and tactically to look at on their iPads.\\n\\n“We’ve got some very tired legs that have to reinvigorate themselves.\\n\\n“But hopefully with that placebo affect, the brain will be telling them that they’re okay.”\\n\\nThe win at Swansea was Sunderland’s second in the space of a fortnight against one of their relegation rivals after the 3-1 victory over Aston Villa earlier this month.\\n\\nThat platform has eased the pressure on a trip to White Hart Lane, where Allardyce admits anything would be a “bonus” for third bottom Sunderland.\\n\\n“If we win at Tottenham, it wouldn’t be as big as winning at Swansea,” he said.\\n\\n“The games against the teams in and around you are the ones that are the real six pointers.\\n\\n“Any point against Tottenham is a bonus. It’s the icing on the cake.\\n\\n“Swansea and Villa were the big ones and we’re showing some mettle now because people tell me last season that the team went under in these games.\\n\\n“We’ve done back to back wins to close the gap.\\n\\n“If we can manage a few draws, then we can chip away at the points total further.”\\n\\nSpurs boss Mauricio Pochettino has the luxury of being able to shuffle his pack, with a deep squad that has coped with the demands of the Europa League this season.\\n\\nHowever, Spurs have showed themselves to be vulnerable on their own patch over recent weeks.\\n\\nSpurs suffered a late 1-0 defeat against second placed Leicester on Wednesday night, while second bottom Newcastle triumphed at White Hart Lane last month.\\n\\n“Tottenham now, with the squad they’ve got, are looking very healthy and productive, no matter what competition they play in,” added Allardyce.\\n\\n“They seem to have, for me, 23-24 very good players who can go in the team, come out and go back in again.\\n\\n“And they still seem to produce results in all competitions.\\n\\n“Whatever team faces us tomorrow, it’ll be very difficult to beat.\\n\\n“Our hope comes from Newcastle beating them recently on their own ground.\\n\\n“Occasionally, they’ve shown at home that they’ve been caught out.\\n\\n“I managed to catch them out there a couple of times at West Ham, as Newcastle did.\\n\\n“Let’s hope we can do something like that tomorrow.”\\n\\n\\n\\nRead more: http://www.sunderlandecho.com/sport/football/sunderland-afc/swansea-win-the-perfect-tonic-for-weary-sunderland-1-7675917#ixzz48Qs2OGwh', 'Heung-Min Son\\'s late cameo in Tottenham Hotspur\\'s 3-0 win over Manchester United on Sunday was, in microcosm, an apt representation of his season.\\n\\nAn almost successful dribble through the Red Devils defence was followed by tidy work maintaining possession soon after. He then smartly slowed things down in second-half stoppage time as Tottenham saw out their victory.A valuable and admirable contribution, but arguably not quite vital to a season in which?like that result?it is others who have led the way. Moving forwards, Son still has work to do justifying the ￡22 million transfer fee paid for him.\\n\\nThis is partly on the 23-year-old himself. But also partly on head coach Mauricio Pochettino still figuring out how and when he can best deploy the attacker.\\n\\nWhere both have got it right in 2015-16 can inform how they look to get more out of the player next season.\\n\\nFor Son himself, he can particularly pinpoint his productive initial spell in the Tottenham team. A timely interjection in the story of the north Londoners\\' season that balances out some of his leaner periods.\\n\\nAfter a winless August Spurs were in need of a lift, especially from an attacking perspective.Son played his part here in his debut away at Sunderland. Although withdrawn shortly after the hour mark, his direct and lively work helped establish the positive momentum that would ultimately help his team to a 1-0 win.\\n\\nThe next few weeks saw even more tangible examples of this. His scoring efforts were especially important given striker Harry Kane\\'s finishing troubles at the time.\\n\\nSon\\'s brace in the 3-1 win over Qarabag helped get Spurs\\' Europa League campaign off to a positive start. Then, a thrilling and explosive match-winning goal three days later against Crystal Palace further invigorated the confidence sparked by their preceding league win.\\n\\nA solid showing in the subsequent 4-1 defeat of Manchester City underlined the early impressions of an adaptable and versatile performer well suited to Pochettino\\'s attack-minded system. One imaginative and energetic while able to adhere to more disciplined requirements (by comparison there were times during those Palace and City games fellow new signing Clinton Njie was clearly reprimanded by Pochettino for not participating in pressing the opposition).\"Son is a player that we followed a long time,\" Pochettino said after the Palace win, praising how \"he is a player who can play with Harry [Kane], No. 9, No. 10, seven, 11, all different positions.\"\\n\\nThe injury Son suffered against Man City, keeping him out until November, undoubtedly disrupted his flow.\\n\\nBy the time he returned, others like Kane, Dele Alli and Erik Lamela were in welcome grooves shaping this impressive Spurs side\\'s play. It was harder for the South Korea international to make an impact when he was less required to do so. Correspondingly, Pochettino began toiling in his attempts to accommodate him on a consistently successful basis.\\n\\nThat indecisiveness has perhaps contributed to recent performances lacking direction and purpose.\\n\\nIndeed, Pochettino might have got a little more out of Son by re-emphasising his importance to the team with recognition of him as the go-to alternative to Kane.The vitality and confidence he displayed in his forward role against Qarabag has been occasionally utilised since?notably in combative efforts against Monaco in Europe and Leicester City in the FA Cup (scoring a fine goal in the latter). But more recently away against Fiorentina and Borussia Dortmund, the Argentinian handed the attack-leading responsibility to Nacer Chadli.\\n\\nOn paper using the Belgian\\'s greater physical stature made sense. But Son\\'s go up-top in the return leg against Dortmund showed where his greater energy may have been better suited against the sturdy Germans at least. Little came off for him until his consolation goal in the defeat, but he had given them much more to think about.\\n\\nWith that said, in other instances the player himself has lacked the urgency that characterised those good early impressions last autumn.\\n\\nSon did not capitalise on his recent starting opportunity against Liverpool, a bright opening giving way to sloppier involvement thereafter. His being replaced by the fit-again, more hard-working Erik Lamela for the Manchester United game was no surprise.As seen with his social media work for the club (see above), Son has taken to life at Tottenham and in England. Those around him have obviously warmed to a seemingly infectious personality too.\\n\\nHeading into next season, Son and Pochettino must work on maximising the similar enthusiasm that defines his best work on the pitch. Be it in establishing a more clearly defined role or better preparing him to augment others wherever he is required to.\\n\\nGet closer to that consistency and Son will be able to prove he was not just a luxury purchase, but one intrinsic to the development of this exciting Tottenham team.', 'An injury to his foot in September’s 4-1 victory over Manchester City ruled Son out for the subsequent six matches however. His hot start was cut short, and in his place Erik Lamela solidified his spot and Dele Alli began his ascent.\\n\\nWhen he did come back, he found his chances at a starting berth diminished significantly. But for stints in which he was brought in to give Lamela a much needed rest, Mauricio Pochettino elected to stay with the hot hands.\\n\\nThough Alli’s suspension has granted Son a nice end-of-season streak of starts ? during which he’s scored twice in as many games ? it’s difficult to look back on this season as anything but a disappointment.Son recently revealed the fact that he shares this sentiment in an article with Ham & High.\\n\\n“This season I think [I’ve been] a little bit unlucky. I started well, got injured and then getting fit took a long time. I’m still getting [back to] 100 per cent. But I’m very happy because I enjoyed this year in Tottenham.”\\n\\nThe transfer fee Son commanded in his August move to Tottenham from Bayer Leverkusen amounted to as much as ￡23 million, making him the third most expensive transfer in the club’s history after Lamela and Roberto Soldado. Expectations were, needless to say, very high.\\n\\nAt 23-years-old, though, Son still has plenty of time to make his case at Tottenham. The club’s qualification for the group stage of next season’s Champions League will presumably mean a more heavily rotated squad, something that Son will inevitably benefit from.\\n\\nThe Champions League is familiar ground for Son. During his time with Leverkusen, he made sixteen total appearances in Europe’s premier international club competition, scoring three goals and setting up three assists. He’s thus well aware of the challenge and opportunity Tottenham have ahead of them.\\n\\n“It’s not an easy competition and we have to look forward, we have to work very hard,” he said. “There are many good teams, [some of the best] in the world. We have to be very focused and be very ready for the Champions League next season.”\\n\\nTottenham will also be occupied with a hopeful title hunt next season as they attempt to build on the surprise success of the current season. While it doesn’t appear as if Lamela or Alli are going anywhere, it’s easy to imagine Son getting more minutes as Pochettino attempts to keep as many balls in the air as possible.', 'Tottenham Hotspur now have a 2-0 lead over Chelsea at Stamford Bridge as halftime approaches. Christian Eriksen again played a huge role in the build-up of the goal. This time he threaded a pass through to Heung-Min Son, who calmly beat Begovic to the near-post. This is going a lot more swimmingly than anyone thought it would have.', 'Heung-Min Son came into this game with the unenviable task of filling Dele Alli’s shoes. Alli is out for the rest of the season after he was hit with a three-game ban for punching Claudio Yacob. Up until this point, Son has three goals on the year, but his impact has mostly been as a super sub. So when he got the call to start, it was up to him to impress his manager Mauricio Pochettino.\\n\\nAfter England and Spurs star Harry Kane put Tottenham up 1-0, Son did just that and scored to give his team a two-goal advantage.Next season will be Tottenham’s first in the Champions League since 2011 and, while Son started a lot of games in the Europa League, Son will be eager to show that he belongs in the Champions League as well. Needless to say, this goal puts him in Pochettino’s good graces.\\n\\nTottenham’s rise as a title contender has been one of the bigger surprises this season ? obviously not as big as Leicester ? and their midfield depth has been a big part of it. If Tottenham keep their core players from this year and are able to upgrade through the transfer market, they’ll be a team to watch out for next year.', 'LONDON -- Tottenham forward Heung-Min Son has no problem playing every three to four days and says he loves the hectic English schedule.\\n\\nSon spent his entire professional career in Germany before joining Spurs from Bayer Leverkusen in the summer, but he prefers the gruelling Premier League and European fixture list to the Bundesliga\\'s winter break.\\n\\nGerman clubs have six weeks off from mid-December until the end of January, while the festive schedule is the busiest time of year for English clubs, typically playing three games in six days.\\n\\nSome Premier League players might therefore be feeling a little jaded at this time of year but not so for Son, who is in no doubt as to his preference.\\n\\n\"I am very happy,\" the forward told reporters. \"In Germany we have two weeks holiday and then we have pre-season again, and maybe one month when we don\\'t play. It\\'s very wrong for me.\\n\\n\"For me now it\\'s very good because every three to four days we have a game. I love to play football. It\\'s my first time here but it\\'s nice to be here -- to play Boxing Days. It\\'s very nice,\" he told reporters.\\n\\nThough Spurs\\' schedule has been eased by Sunday\\'s 1-0 FA Cup defeat to Crystal Palace, and arguably the North Londoners will be better off focussing on Europe and their Premier League title challenge.\\n\\nSon, however, says the Spurs squad were left \"angry\" by their fifth-round exit but insisted the focus is now on their two remaining competitions.\\n\\n\"It\\'s now finished. We have to concentrate on the Europa League. \"We can\\'t play every game, or every tournament like the FA Cup, the Europa League and Premier League. Now we can concentrate on the Europa League and Premier League.\\n\\n\"Because we lost I am angry, we are angry, but this is football. We have to understand.\"\\n\\nHowever, the South Korea international conceded that Spurs\\' exit may help the squad in the long run.\\n\\nWhen asked if fewer games could prove beneficial to Spurs, he replied: \"Yeah, I think so because it\\'s now going towards the end of the season and all the players may be tired. Now it\\'s very important -- we have two tournaments to play.\\n\\n\"We are not happy because we are out of the FA Cup. We have to understand that we can now concentrate on the Premier League and Europa League.\"\\n\\nSpurs dominated possession and had the better chances against the Eagles but were undone by Martin Kelly\\'s sucker-punch during first half stoppage time.\\n\\nDele Alli, Harry Kane, Joshua Onomah and Christian Eriksen all went close to finding an equaliser which would have set-up a replay at Selhurst Park, causing more scheduling woes for Spurs and the FA.Son, however, believes the squad would have coped with an extra match, adding: \"If we scored in the last minute, it\\'s a replay but I think we have the quality for FA Cup.\\n\\n\"We would really be tired but why not? Spurs have little time to dwell on the defeat, with Fiorentina the visitors to White Hart Lane on Thursday for the Europa League round-of-32 second leg.\\n\\nThe first leg in Florence finished 1-1, leaving Spurs favourites to finish the job at home, but Son believes they will have to be at their best to beat the Italians, who are currently third in the Serie A.\\n\\n\"I\\'m very excited but we have to win this game. We have four days until we play -- we can relax and recover. We have to be really focussed and we have to win this game. We\\'re ready, I hope we win against Fiorentina. They are a very good team and we need to be very focussed.\"\\n\\nSon was named man-of-the-match by broadcasters against Palace but the 23-year-old says Spurs fans have still not seen the best of him.\\n\\n\"I come a little bit after injury. Now I feel better than before. I know I can play much better, I can score more also! I have to try with the team. I will do everything for the team. That\\'s it.\"', 'Son Heung-min says he is waiting to be cleared by Tottenham to realise his dream of representing South Korea at the Olympic Games this year.\\nOnly three players over the age of 23 can be selected by nations for the Olympics and, with Son turning 24 in July, Korea need Spurs\\' permission to allow him to play in Rio de Janeiro.\\nHead coach Uli Stielike claimed in March that Son had not been selected for the national team during the international window as compromise for allowing him to feature in Brazil.\\nHowever, allowing Son to play would disrupt his involvement for the start of the next Premier League season, but the former Bayer Leverkusen forward is hopeful of representing his country.\\n\"We\\'re still waiting for the decision so I can\\'t say anything,\" he is quoted as saying by ESPN.\\n\"Why not [play]? It\\'s a very nice tournament and competition and every player wants to go to play there. \\n\"I\\'ve played in the World Cup and Asian Cup and I haven\\'t played in the Olympics. We\\'ll see what happens.\"', 'Tottenham Hotspur snapped up talented South Korean international Heung-min Son in the summer from German side Bayer Leverkusen.\\n\\nThe player cost, according to the Guardian, a sizeable sum in the region of ￡22 million and arrived with plenty of promise.\\n\\nHowever, despite showing real glimpses of his undoubted quality, Son has often found himself on the bench this season and has also had to battle with injury at time.\\n\\nNow he has had a stark warning from his international boss that he needs to be a regular to play for his country.Speaking to the Korea Times Dutchman Uli Stielike had this to say about the South Korea star ? and others who were not regular first-team starters:\\n\\n\"I am curious how they will turn out in transfers this summer.\\n\\n\"I have some expectations that those players (who are not playing regularly) may have more opportunities in new teams. It is very important for them to play regularly.\\n\\n\"I think calling up players who have not played as regular members for about six months to the World Cup squad wouldn\\'t be appropriate.\"\\n\\nSon certainly has some need to be concerned.\\n\\nHe has played just 920 minutes in the Premier League this season. Compared to his peers at Spurs that does not read well. Erik Lamela has played 1939 minutes whilst Christian Eriksen and Dele Alli have played 2491 and 2308 respectively.So the Korean needs to establish himself as more of a regular fixture at Tottenham if he is to secure himself a place in the national team in the years to come.\\n\\nIf not, it seems Stielike would like him to consider a Tottenham exit.', \"Now that the draw for the 2018 AFC World Cup final qualifying round is out, it is time to take a closer look into which of the region's top players will be up against one another as the games play out.\\n\\nThere will be some fascinating matchups over the coming months, as the best teams on the continent fight it out over the course of 10 games.\\n\\nOnly four Asian nations will be guaranteed World Cup spots, with another two facing more playoffs for a chance to make it to Russia 2018.\\n\\nThe matches begin in September and will conclude in November 2017.What a battle this could be between the Australian goalscoring talisman and Japan's classy centre-back.

The rest, and his two goals in the last six minutes, is history.\\n\\nThe former Everton man has caused problems in the past with his aerial ability but Yoshida has been enjoying himself in the Premier League with Southampton over the years.\\n\\nBut his debut in the English game was a tough one. Yoshida was at the back when Arsenal won 6-1. He has adapted well to the physical demands of the Premier League to become a fixture in the Saints' backline.\\n\\nYoshida will be relishing the chance to face Japan's old nemesis. The two meetings are likely to mark the last time that Cahill takes the field against the Samurai Blue. He will want to sign off in a blaze of glory.\\n\\nJapan's top centre-back will want to stop him. Cahill remains the AFC player that Japanese fans fear the most.This qualification campaign will be a major one for the UAE playmaker. 'Amoory' was a standout player at the 2015 AFC Asian Cup and has been one of the most exciting that the continent has produced in a long time.\\n\\nRightly or wrongly, he is not about to be heading to the big leagues of Europe but fans around Asia will get another chance to see his talents. The Al Ain man pulls the attacking strings for the UAE, buzzing around behind the team's dangerous strikers.\\n\\nAbdulrahman likes to roam free and will be a handful for the War Elephants defence and midfield, including Sarach.\\n\\nThe Muangthong favourite is developing into a disciplined midfielder. His performance against Iraq in March in the all-important draw to clinch top spot in the second round group was top notch. Sarach sat in front of the backline and broke down Iraqi attacks to help his team maintain possession in the pressure encounter.\\n\\nThe 23-year-old could be about to face his toughest test in the shape of the UAE's bushy-haired magician.If 'Sonaldo' can find his form for his country then South Korea will be confident of a ninth successive appearance on the global stage. The Spurs attacker is yet to achieve his full potential with his country but is surely not far away.\\n\\nHe has also yet to do the same for Tottenham Hotspur since his big-money move last summer from Bayer Leverkusen. But there is one benefit from his failure to become a regular starter as his jet-fuelled heels will be fresh and ready to run at the Chinese back four.\\n\\nZhang Linpeng is regarded as one of Asia's best defenders, probably why Chelsea made a bid, rejected by Asian champions Guangzhou Evergrande, last summer.\\n\\nThe athletic 26-year-old can play at right-back or in the middle but, wherever he is, he'll have his hands full with the South Korean express.\\n\\nIf China and Zhang can stop Son, then Team Dragon will fancy their chances of shocking their more accomplished neighbours.If Leicester City win the Premier League, the visit of Japan to Bangkok in September will be an even bigger deal, thanks to the presence of Shinji Okazaki.\\n\\nThe Japanese striker has been a vital part in the success of the Siamese Foxes and is sure to get a warm welcome in the City of Angels. With 48 goals in 100 appearances, Okazaki has an excellent scoring record and, even without his Southeast Asian connections, will be the man to watch for Thailand.\\n\\nGoalkeeper Kawin will have his work cut out between the sticks. The 26-year-old has been one of the leading goalkeepers in the region for years, even if his dream of playing in the big leagues of Europe has yet to come true.\\n\\nThe next best thing may be testing himself against the striker from the English champions in a vital World Cup qualifier in Bangkok.\\n\\nOf course, Kawin and Thailand will also be kept busy in November and December when they defend their AFF Suzuki Cup crown.Nasser Al Shamrani was the 2014 Asian Player of the Year but has not been a feature of the Saudi Arabia football team under Bert Van Marwijk. But it would be interesting, to say the least, if he was recalled for the clashes against Australia.\\n\\nThe Saudi striker was banned for six games for spitting at the Aussie defender as Al Hilal lost the 2014 Asian Champions League final to Western Sydney Wanderers where Spiranovic was a defensive rock.\\n\\nA reunion would add a certain frisson to the tie. But even if Al Shamrani does not get a call-up, there will still be plenty for Spriranovic and his fellow Socceroos to deal with. Mohammad Al Sahlawi is the top scorer on the road to Russia so far, with 14 goals in the second round.\\n\\nFormer Bundesliga defender Spiranovic, who's now a teammate of Tim Cahill at Chinese club Hangzhou Greentown, is sure to have his hands full. He is likely to be partnered at the back by Trent Sainsbury who provided a stingy defence at last year's Asian Cup, with only one goal conceded in the knockout stages.\", \"Tottenham missed the chance to all-but wrap up second place after they slipped to a 2-1 defeat to Southampton at White Hart Lane this afternoon.\\n\\nMauricio Pochettino's side started strongly in glorious sunshine and went in front before the game was 20 minutes old courtesy of Heung-min Son's fourth goal of the season.\\n\\nThe South Korean picked up the ball from deep and exchanged passes with Erik Lamela before rounding Fraser Forster and firing home into an unguarded net.\\n\\nThe visitors slowly worked their way back into the game and while Spurs enjoyed dominance in possession, the Saints were a constant threat on the counter attack and drew level on the half hour mark.Shane Long out muscled Toby Alderweireld and fizzed a ball across the face of goal, which Steven Davis met at the near post.\\n\\nHugo Lloris was unable to stop the Northern Irishman's effort, despite getting a strong hand to the ball.\\n\\nCriticising the goalkeeper could appear harsh but a player of his calibre should have kept the strike out.Harry Kane missed a superb chance on the stroke of half time when he opted to shoot from a tight angle rather than square to Erik Lamela and the two sides went in level.\\n\\nSpurs were made to rue the missed opportunity when Davis exchanged passes with Shane Long and drilled a low effort in the bottom corner on 72 minutes.Heavy legs were present on both sides during the closing stages, with the searing heat clearly playing a part, and Spurs were unable to find an equaliser, which means the fight for second place will go to the last day.\\n\\nRonald Koeman's side, meanwhile, can continue to dream of a Europa League place after leapfrogging West Ham into sixth place.\", 'Tottenham Hotspur have one match left this season, with the task of securing second place in the Premier League still at hand. Yet after the disappointment of missing out on the title, the present understandably holds less fascination.\\n\\nThe future of this team and what it could achieve with head coach Mauricio Pochettino is quickly taking precedence, and with it speculation over who will be chief among their transfer targets this summer.Speaking after Tottenham\\'s 2-1 loss with Southampton, Pochettino sensibly pointed out that improving his team is not just about new signings.\\n\\n\"I have a very clear [idea] the areas we need to improve and how,\" the Argentinian said. \"Doesn’t mean that we need to add players, means that we need to improve. The same players that we have need to move on and improve. Some players in different situations?tactical, mentality and different things.\\n\\n\"But the most important thing is we know how.\"\\n\\nWhile he\\'s understandably keen to reiterate the worth of those already at the club, bringing in new players is as much a part of improving them as anything else. Keeping current first-teamers on their toes with competition for places, as well as lightening the workload for some.\\n\\nPochettino\\'s intentions for his central midfield will be interesting to see.In the resurgent Mousa Demble, refocused Eric Dier and?a little further forward?the precocious Dele Alli, he has three of the division\\'s best performers in this position in 2015-16. Numbers wise Spurs look fine, too, with the department full but feeling less bloated than a year ago, when Etienne Capoue and Benjamin Stambouli were marginalised and Paulinho was also on his way out.\\n\\nNonetheless, Pochettino has already proved he is not a manager to rest on his laurels. The downgrading of Nabil Bentaleb\\'s and Ryan Mason\\'s statuses this season have been examples to his whole squad of the need for continued progression and a good helping of fortune.\\n\\nSpurs are in decent shape at full-back, with the improved Danny Rose and Kyle Walker supported by Ben Davies and Kieran Trippier. The latter two are likely to be better for their experiences this season, while USA international DeAndre Yedlin will be back from his loan at Sunderland?though he may find he is best served with a move elsewhere.\\n\\nCentral defence falls more into the aforementioned criteria of needing to augment, motivate and aid the current group with a new addition.\\n\\n']\n"
